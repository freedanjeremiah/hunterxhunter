# Walrus CLI Requirements
# This application uses only Python standard library modules
# No additional pip installations required

# Python Standard Library modules used:
# - argparse (command-line argument parsing)
# - json (JSON data handling)
# - hashlib (SHA-256 hashing)
# - zipfile (directory compression/extraction)  
# - tempfile (temporary file management)
# - subprocess (walrus command execution)
# - pathlib (path manipulation)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)

# External Dependencies:
# - Walrus CLI tool (must be installed separately and available in PATH)
#   Installation instructions: https://docs.walrus.storage/
#
# Walrus CLI provides commands:
# - walrus store <file>    (stores blob and returns blob ID)
# - walrus blob <blob_id>  (retrieves blob by ID)

# Python Version Requirement:
# Python 3.7 or higher (for pathlib and other modern features)

# Optional Development Dependencies:
# pytest>=6.0.0  # For running tests (if added)
# black>=21.0.0  # For code formatting (if needed)
# mypy>=0.900    # For type checking (if needed)
